********************* TODO *********************

All application components render on-screen in a responsive manner.

Map displays all location markers by default, and displays the filtered subset of location markers when a filter is applied.

A README file is included detailing all steps required to successfully run the application.


***************** FINISHED TODOS *****************


>>> Markers should animate when clicked (e.g. bouncing, color change.)
>>> If an API doesn’t load there should be some visible indication on the page (an alert box is ok) that it didn’t load. Note: You do not need to handle cases where the user goes offline.
