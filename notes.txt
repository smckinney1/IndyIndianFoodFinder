********************* TODO *********************

All application components render on-screen in a responsive manner.

List functionality is responsive and runs error free.

Map displays all location markers by default, and displays the filtered subset of location markers when a filter is applied.

if using Foursquare, indicate somewhere in your UI and in your README that you are using Foursquare data.

A README file is included detailing all steps required to successfully run the application.

Rather than using Bootstrap modals or jQuery UI, I elected to learn how to create a modal on my own using Traversy Media's [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ophW7Ask_0) tutorial. I modified styling and markup where I felt appropriate.


***************** FINISHED TODOS *****************


>>> Markers should animate when clicked (e.g. bouncing, color change.)
>>> If an API doesn’t load there should be some visible indication on the page (an alert box is ok) that it didn’t load. Note: You do not need to handle cases where the user goes offline.
