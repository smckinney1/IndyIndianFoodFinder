## About

This project uses the Google Maps and Foursquare APIs to render data and locations for Indian restaurants around Indianapolis. The restaurants presented are all restaurants I have visited.

## Instructions

For now, the project must be downloaded and run from your local files. I plan to host this on GitHub once finished.

## Code & Credits
