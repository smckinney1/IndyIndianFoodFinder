## About

This project uses the Google Maps and Foursquare APIs to render data and locations for Indian restaurants around Indianapolis. The restaurants presented are all restaurants I have visited.

## Instructions

For now, the project must be downloaded and run from your local files. I plan to host this on GitHub once finished.

## Code & Credits

- The favicon for this site was obtained from [freefavicon](https://www.freefavicon.com/).
- The map markers were obtained from the [Maps Icon Collection](https://mapicons.mapsmarker.com/markers/tourism/pin/).
- The map style object is from [Snazzy Maps](https://snazzymaps.com/style/128473/pink)/

Rather than using Bootstrap modals or jQuery UI, I elected to learn how to create a modal on my own using Traversy Media's [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ophW7Ask_0) tutorial. I modified styling and markup where I felt appropriate.

Libraries used:
- jQuery
- Knockout.js
